"""
This settings file is optimized for local development.  It should work equally well for bare-metal development and for
running inside of development environments such as tutor.

WARNING: THIS FILE IS EXPERIMENTAL
These settings are currently in development themselves. They may not work for everyone out of the box.
More updates, including updated documentation will be added as we get closer to removing devstack.py.
Breaking changes are likely.

# Meilisearch. "openedx_" is a sensible default; the base default in cms/envs/common.py is "".

# breaking change for existing deployments (their unprefixed indexes would need a reindex), so we
# set it here for development only until that migration is handled separately.

# Meilisearch derives every API key's value as HMAC-SHA256(master_key, key_uid): you choose the
# UID, and Meilisearch determines the key value. By fixing both the master key and the UID as shared
# dev constants, the derived key is the same for everyone, so we compute it here -- rather than each
# developer having to fetch a randomly-generated key from their own Meilisearch and paste a
# per-person value into this shared file. MEILISEARCH_MASTER_KEY must match the MEILI_MASTER_KEY of
# whatever Meilisearch instance you run locally.
#
# Meilisearch cannot declare a key at boot, so a key with this UID must also be created once in your
# Meilisearch (this is idempotent -- Meilisearch returns an error if the UID already exists, which
# you can ignore):
